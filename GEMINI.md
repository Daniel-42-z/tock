- Build the project in the `build/` directory
- Every time the config format changes, update the `sample_config.toml` file to reflect the change
- Don't try to directly run `tock show` since it requires an interactive terminal to start correctly
- Read `OUTLINE.md` to understand the project structure
- Update `OUTLINE.md` when changing the project structure, maintaining the existing format and explaining the logic
